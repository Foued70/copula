The files in this directory are used to compute the probability of a copula model, given some set of empirical CDF. 
Currently, only a subset of bivariate copulas are supported, described in the paper:
Huard, D., Ã‰vin, G. and Favre, A-C. Bayesian Copula Selection, Journal of Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 2005, 51, 809-822.

The main function is bcs.m, which computes the probability for a collection of copula families. 
By looking at this function, it is possible to understand what the code does. Look also at test_method.m.

The code was written mostly by G. Evin and D. Huard. It uses and extends functions written by A. Perkins.
This is not an public release. There is no implied warranty that the code provides correct result, although we certainly hope so. 

I changed some of the docs and function names, and since I don't have Matlab installed anymore, I can't test it right now. Please forward any comments or bugs to 
david.huard@gmail.com

I'm not officially maintaining the code, but I can help.
